# NO NOOBS ALLOWED
# METAshell is an innovative tool designed for shell command metadata injection and dynamic one-liner generation.
# METAshell takes a shell command and an image, video or text file as input. It then injects the command into the file using metadata comments. After injection, it generates a one-liner execution method for retrieving and executing the injected command from a remote location.
